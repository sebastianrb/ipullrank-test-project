            <p class="header__subtitle">It is common to feel like a fish out of water when navigating Medicare. Though popular and useful to millions of seniors, there are many people – beneficiaries and prospects alike – who have varied misconceptions about the nationwide health insurance program.</p>

                    <p class="section-content__standard-text font-change">There are many misconceptions around the facts and details of Medicare. Some of these come from the general public, while others spring directly from Medicare’s annual cost and benefit changes.</p>
                    <p class="section-content__standard-text font-change">The costs of Medicare, primarily the premiums, change every year. Couple that with the different plans and coverage amounts and you have a perfect storm for confusion.

                            <p class="section-content__standard-text font-change">Unfortunately, it is not free of charges; it is made up of premiums, deductibles, coinsurance costs, prescription drug costs and other out-of-pocket costs.</p>

The ACA was not intended to replace Medicare and it will not take away any of the guaranteed benefits of Medicare. In fact, the ACA has in part made Medicare stronger, as it prohibits cuts to Medicare guaranteed benefits. The Affordable Care Act has provisions purposed with reducing the costs of Medicare, eliminating fraud and waste, providing patient-centered care and covering preventative care against chronic conditions.</p>

This period runs from October 15-December 7 each year. Although a major enrollment period, the AEP is not the only time period in which people can enroll in Medicare. In fact, this is the period in which beneficiaries make changes to their plans, so it does not pertain to hopeful enrollees. For those new to Medicare, there is the IEP, or <span class="red-span">Initial Enrollment Period</span>, which is a 7-month period surrounding your 65th birthday. The GEP, or <span class="red-span">General Enrollment Period</span>, exists if you’ve missed the IEP. There’s also the Special Enrollment Period, or SEP, for those obtaining health insurance from current employers and thus miss their IEP.</p>

Restructuring Medicare is usually proposed in the context of a budget, with the end goal of saving money. This would be achieved be making middle and upper income beneficiaries pay more out-of-pocket costs, with less in return, killing the purpose of redesigning Medicare. For example, policy changes are constantly brought up among policymakers, one of which proposes the implementation of a single co-insurance rate, which would up the costs to beneficiaries. <span class="red-span">The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)</span> Innovation Center conducts tests on these types of policies to assure a desirable experience for Medicare beneficiaries. CMS gets some of its ideas from the beneficiaries themselves, by having them submit theirs online.</p>

This 3-year pilot program was developed due to the rise in fraudulent transportation operators, who had increased the number of nonemergency ambulance uses.

The main reason behind Medicare’s rising costs is due to its demographics. Now that baby boomers are entering the age of retirement, there are more seniors dependent upon Medicare. With more beneficiaries tied to Medicare, it has a wider net to cover. The Medicare system partially holds the blame for increasing costs, as doctors and hospitals capitalize on the fact that Medicare will pay for expensive drugs and procedures.</p>
