# ipullrank-test-project repo

#### Live demo: https://sebastianrb.github.io/ipullrank-test-project/

#### Notes about the organization and workflow:

* I completed this project using a Gulp-based workflow
* I used the Sass preprocessor to generate the CSS
* All of the development code is processed (minified, concatenated, etc...) and the production-ready code is saved to the `dest` directory. `index.html` references files in this directory
